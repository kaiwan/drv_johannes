Simple RAM-to-RAM memcpy DMA test...
Currently only supported on:
- Raspberry Pi
- TI BBB

(won't run on x86 / x86 VMs).

Alternate way to test DMA - a probably better one - is via the upstream
kernel module 'dmatest' : https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/dmaengine/dmatest.html
(under drivers/dma/dmatest in the kernel src tree).
